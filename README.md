# task

Write a function defaultArguments. It takes a function as an argument, along with an object containing default values for that function's arguments, and returns another function which defaults to the right values.

You cannot assume that the function's arguments have any particular names.

You should be able to call defaultArguments repeatedly to change the defaults.
